/*Memo and Momo are playing a game. Memo will choose a positive number a, and Momo will choose a positive number b.
Your task is to tell them who will win according to the following rules:

If both a and b are divisible by k, both of them win and you should print "Both".
If a is divisible by k but b isn't, Memo wins and you should print "Memo".
If b  is divisible by k  but a isn't, Momo wins and you should print "Momo".
If both a and b are not divisible by k, no one wins and you should print "No One".

Input
Only one line containing three positive numbers a, b and k (1≤a,b,k≤1018).

Output
Print the answer as described in the statement.
